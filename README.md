## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that it is best to seperate the content from the styling in the html. For example wrapping a picture in a div to do the styling in the div rather than making the image itself a flex item.
